# Stock News Bot
Old project from 2020 - 2021

This program does 2 things:
1. Retrieve the stock information for the stocks you want.
2. Track the progress of the chosen stocks while the program is running.

At the time I made this, I was learning about web scrapping and got interested about the stock market so I thought that this would make a nice learning project :)

## How to Run

  1. Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/juanmartin8a/Stock-News-Bot.git
     cd Stock-News-Bot

  2. Run the program: `python main.py`

  3. Follow along!
